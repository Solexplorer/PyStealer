Small script to run in order to find addresses with ether

I made this script in order to run it when my virtual machine is idle, just for fun purposes.

Install these python modules:

`pip install base58`

`pip install ecdsa`

`pip install web3`

`pip install eth_account`

`pip install RandomWords`

Make sure to have a project id from INFURA, it's used to check for ETH balances.
